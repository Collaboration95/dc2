"""The reaper's data-touching paths, against real PostgreSQL and MinIO.

These deliberately do **not** call `run_once()`.

`run_once()` sweeps the whole jobs table and the entire `uploads/` prefix, and
deletes what it judges orphaned. Running that against a shared database would
reap other people's in-flight work and delete their objects -- and this suite
is pointed at whatever `POSTGRES_DSN` says, which on a developer machine is the
same stack they are using. A test that is destructive to everything but itself
is not a test worth having.

So the orchestration stays covered by fakes in `tests/test_reaper.py`, and
these cover the pieces that actually talk to a service, scoped to rows and keys
this file created. Between them every line the reaper depends on is exercised
against something real.
