# Flickpond

Flickpond is a practice-module team project: an asynchronous video upload and processing platform. Sprint 1 proved the request path end to end with a copy job standing in for transcoding; **sprint 2 replaced it with real FFmpeg**, added authentication and per-user ownership, a reaper that recovers jobs abandoned by a crashed worker, CI as a required check on `main`, and TLS.

It is deployed at **<https://flickpond.com>**.

## Architecture

| Component        | Responsibility                                                       | Default local address                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| nginx (frontend) | Serves the UI; proxies `/api/` and `/videos/`. The only public port. | `http://localhost:3000` (deploy: `:80`)                             |
| FastAPI          | Upload and job-status HTTP API                                       | `127.0.0.1:8000` (loopback only)                                    |
| PostgreSQL       | Durable job metadata and processing state                            | `127.0.0.1:5432`                                                    |
| Redis + RQ       | Delivery of job IDs to workers                                       | `127.0.0.1:6379`                                                    |
| MinIO            | Original and processed video objects                                 | API `127.0.0.1:9000`, console `127.0.0.1:9001` (both loopback only) |
| Worker           | FFmpeg transcode to 720p MP4, one-way state transitions              | Internal Compose service                                            |
| Reaper           | Fails rows a dead worker abandoned; sweeps orphaned objects          | Internal Compose service                                            |

The queue coordinates work, PostgreSQL records state, and MinIO stores the video bytes. Workers remain stateless, so any worker replica can process any queued job.

### Port policy

**nginx is the only service published beyond loopback.** The API, MinIO's S3 API
and console, PostgreSQL and Redis are pinned to `127.0.0.1` in
`docker-compose.yml` and that is deliberately not configurable.

The API enforces per-user ownership (S2-03), but the datastores behind it do
not: anything that reaches PostgreSQL or MinIO directly reads every user's data.
That is what the loopback binding is for, and why it stays even though the
application now authenticates its own callers.

Reach an internal service from another machine with a tunnel, not a published
port:

```bash
ssh -L 5432:127.0.0.1:5432 user@host    # psql against localhost:5432
ssh -L 9001:127.0.0.1:9001 user@host    # MinIO console on localhost:9001
```

A deployment anyone else can reach sets `FRONTEND_BIND=0.0.0.0` and
`FRONTEND_PORT=80`. The app authenticates its own callers, so no separate gate
is needed — see [`docs/s2-03-auth-design.md`](docs/s2-03-auth-design.md).

Note that `ufw` will not save you here: Docker publishes ports through its own
iptables chain and bypasses ufw entirely, so a host that believes it is
firewalled is not ([T-06](docs/known-traps.md#t-06)).

```

## Prerequisites

- Windows 11 with WSL 2 and an Ubuntu distribution
- Docker Desktop with WSL integration enabled for Ubuntu
- Git configured inside WSL

Run all commands below inside Ubuntu WSL, not PowerShell:

```bash
cd /mnt/e/workspace/Media_player
```

## Quick start

Create the local environment file. `.env` is ignored by Git.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Build and start all six services:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps
```

Wait until every service reports `healthy`, then check the API:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/jobs
```

Expected responses from an empty installation:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
[]
```

Then open the app:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Choose a video file and click Upload. The status line moves through
`Queued...` -> `Processing...` -> `Processing complete.` and the player appears
with the processed result.

Use `localhost:3000` (or `127.0.0.1:3000`) exactly. The API's CORS allowlist
only accepts those two origins, and opening `frontend/index.html` directly from
disk will not work - the browser sends a `null` origin and every request is
blocked.

Interactive API documentation is available at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>.

View logs or stop the stack without deleting data:

```bash
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose down
```

`docker compose down -v` also deletes the local PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO volumes. Use it only when a completely clean local state is intended.

## Database migrations

The API container applies pending migrations before Uvicorn starts. Migrations can also be inspected or applied manually:

```bash
docker compose run --rm api alembic current
docker compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head
```

Inspect the current table directly:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres \
  psql -U flickpond -d flickpond -c '\d+ jobs'
```

The `jobs` table uses UUID identifiers and exactly four lowercase states:

```text
queued -> processing -> done
                     -> failed
```

Database constraints reject unknown states, a `done` row without `output_key`, and a `failed` row without a readable error. Indexes exist on `status` and `created_at`.

## Upload API

```http
POST /upload
```

Multipart form with a single `file` field. Stores the object, inserts the job
row, enqueues the job id, and returns immediately - it never waits for
processing:

```json
{"job_id": "9b4595b8-9bd3-4a71-b99d-488c7c7f381c"}
```

Returns `202`. Rejections:

| Status | Body                                                         | When                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `413`  | `{"error": "file too large"}`                                | Above the 100MB limit. Checked against `Content-Length` before the body is read, and again against the bytes that arrived.                                              |
| `415`  | `{"error": "unsupported media type"}`                        | The declared `Content-Type` is not an accepted video type.                                                                                                              |
| `415`  | `{"error": "file content is not a recognized video format"}` | The bytes are not a recognised video container. The declared type is attacker-supplied — a browser fills it in from the file extension — so the content is checked too. |

The stored object is served back under the *sniffed* type, not the client's claim.

## Status API

Get one job:

```http
GET /jobs/{uuid}
```

Get a page of jobs, newest first:

```http
GET /jobs?limit=50&offset=0
```

`limit` defaults to 50 and is capped at 200; `offset` defaults to 0. Ordering is `created_at` descending with `id` breaking ties, so paging never repeats or drops a row. Out-of-range values return `422`.

Queued response:

```json
{
  "id": "9b4595b8-9bd3-4a71-b99d-488c7c7f381c",
  "filename": "demo.mp4",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

Completed response:

```json
{
  "id": "9b4595b8-9bd3-4a71-b99d-488c7c7f381c",
  "filename": "demo.mp4",
  "status": "done",
  "output_url": "http://127.0.0.1:9000/videos/...signed-query..."
}
```

Internal `source_key` and `output_key` values never appear in HTTP responses. A completed job receives a time-limited `output_url`; the frontend must use this URL for playback.

An unknown UUID returns:

```json
{"error":"not found"}
```

## Shared repository interface

`app.repositories.jobs` exposes asynchronous functions for the upload API and worker:

```python
create_job(session, filename=..., source_key=..., job_id=None)
get_job(session, job_id)
list_jobs(session, *, limit=50, offset=0)
mark_processing(session, job_id)
mark_done(session, job_id, output_key=...)
mark_failed(session, job_id, error=...)
```

Integration rules:

- B calls `create_job` after storing the source object, then enqueues the returned job ID.
- A is the sole caller of `mark_processing`, `mark_done`, and `mark_failed`.
- C's GET endpoints only read state and create output URLs.
- E reads `output_url`, never `output_key`, and stops polling on `done` or `failed`.

The transition functions use conditional SQL updates. Repeating or skipping a transition raises `InvalidJobTransitionError` instead of silently overwriting the row.

## MinIO addresses

Two endpoint variables are intentional:

- `MINIO_ENDPOINT=minio:9000` is the internal Compose address used by API and worker code.
- `MINIO_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=127.0.0.1:9000` is embedded in signed URLs returned to the browser. The deployment sets it to `flickpond.com`.

Do not generate browser URLs with `minio:9000`; that hostname only resolves inside the Compose network. Set `MINIO_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` to the public storage hostname when deploying remotely.

The **host is part of a SigV4 signature**, so the two endpoints cannot be swapped after a URL is signed, and `MINIO_PUBLIC_USE_SSL` must match the page's scheme or the browser blocks the result as mixed content.

## Tests and code quality

Start the dependency services, then run the full Python 3.12 test suite:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis minio
docker compose run --rm \
  -e RUN_POSTGRES_TESTS=1 \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" -w /workspace api \
  sh -c "python -m pip install -e '.[dev]' && \
         ruff check . && ruff format --check . && \
         pytest --cov=app"
```

Without `RUN_POSTGRES_TESTS=1`, tests that require a real PostgreSQL service are skipped. The configured coverage gate is 80%.

The frontend has its own suite (Node 20+ required):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm test                                    # unit tests, mocked fetch
RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1 npx vitest run app.live.test.js   # against the running stack
```

CI sends Python and frontend coverage to SonarCloud for static security
analysis. Create the SonarCloud project with Automatic Analysis disabled, then
configure the repository with the `SONAR_TOKEN` secret and the
`SONAR_PROJECT_KEY` and `SONAR_ORGANIZATION` variables. The Quality Gate should
require an A security rating on new code. The scan currently reports its gate
result without blocking the PR while the initial baseline is reviewed; forked
PRs without access to the secret skip the scan with a warning.

The separate DAST workflow runs an authenticated OWASP ZAP API scan against an
isolated Compose stack on relevant pull requests, every Monday at 03:00 UTC,
and on manual dispatch. It never targets the deployed site. High, medium, low,
and informational findings are summarized without blocking the PR while the
baseline is reviewed; a ZAP infrastructure failure still fails the workflow.
HTML, JSON, Markdown, XML, and application logs are retained as workflow
artifacts for 30 days. No repository secret is required because every DAST
credential exists only for the lifetime of the disposable runner. The DAST
stack builds its pinned MinIO release from source because MinIO's community
container registries no longer allow anonymous pulls; this override does not
change the image used by normal deployments.

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the complete list. Never commit `.env` or real credentials.

## Git workflow

Each role has an integration branch. Create a short-lived personal branch from the role branch, open a pull request back to that role branch, and merge the completed role branch into `main` only after integration testing.

Example for track C:

```bash
git switch C-status-endpoints-db
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c <name>/c-status-db

# After committing and testing:
git push -u origin <name>/c-status-db
```

Before committing, confirm that `git config user.email` belongs to the contributor's GitHub account so the work appears in the contribution history.

## What is and is not built

Built, through sprint 2:

```text
register/login -> upload -> queued -> processing (FFmpeg 720p) -> done | failed
                                   -> status API -> playback URL
                     reaper recovers rows abandoned by a dead worker
```

Sprint 3 track C adds the owner-scoped `POST /jobs/{id}/retry` endpoint and
source-aware crop/clip validation. See the [C handoff](docs/c-recovery-input-safety.md)
for usage, transaction behaviour, and the B/E integration still required before
claiming the complete editing feature works in the browser.

Still out of scope here: format selection, quotas, resumable or multipart
upload, cloud orchestration, and instant session revocation (the JWT is
stateless and stays valid until it expires — see
[`docs/s2-03-auth-design.md`](docs/s2-03-auth-design.md) §1).

Upload is also **not atomic**: the object lands in MinIO before the job row is
committed, so a crash between the two leaves an orphaned object. The reaper
sweeps those; the reasoning is in
[`docs/sprint2-backlog.md`](docs/sprint2-backlog.md).
# Project 2 working repository

The former `Media_player` submodule now lives directly in this repository.
Run application, test and Docker commands from this root; no submodule checkout
is needed. See [current decisions and work log](docs/project2-worklog.txt).
The original application documentation follows below.
