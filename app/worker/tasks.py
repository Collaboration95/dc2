"""The job task and its state machine.

Contract rules this file exists to enforce:

* The worker is the sole writer to `status`, `output_key`, `error` and
  `updated_at` after the API's insert (N4). Every write here goes through
  `app.repositories.jobs`, never raw SQL.
* Transitions are one-way: queued -> processing -> done | failed. There are no
  retries in sprint 1.
* A job that fails reaches `failed` with a readable error. It never hangs in
  `processing` because of an exception this process could see (N3).
* Every transition is logged with the job id (N9).
