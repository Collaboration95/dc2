"""Register, log in, log out, and report who you are.

The token is a signed JWT delivered in an HttpOnly cookie. That is deliberate
and has a consequence worth knowing before changing anything here: JavaScript
cannot read the cookie, which is the point, but it also means the frontend
cannot decode the token to find out who it is. That is what `GET /auth/me` is
for, and it is why logout has to be a server endpoint -- a script cannot delete
an HttpOnly cookie itself.

    Worth being honest about what this does: the JWT itself stays valid until

    allows. The short lifetime in `jwt_ttl_seconds` is the real bound.

    The cookie is deleted on the response object that is actually returned, not
    on an injected one. Returning a different Response discards whatever was set
    on the injected parameter -- FastAPI only merges those headers when the
