# Drop root for the runtime. The install above needs it to write into the

# writes it, and PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE stops Python trying to drop .pyc files
# beside it. Uploads spool to /tmp, which stays writable, and binding port 8000
# needs no privilege. Both the api and worker services run from this image, so
# both drop root together.
